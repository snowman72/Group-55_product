                    Two major components: A portable computer with AI and a mind reading machine. MIT's AlterEgo headset enables a person to talk with a computing device without using their voice or making visible motions. It allows them to connect with AI assistants in a quiet, disguised, and seamless manner. A human user might communicate just by vocalizing internally (subtle internal motions) or by moving their head in a variety of ways. The computer uses a HD (high definition) map of the country where the user lives to help artificial intelligence (AI) work out the 'optimal' route for users. The wheelchair even incorporates a fisheye camera at the back of the portable computer with super-wide lenses to provide a 360-degree view of its surroundings. A lidar sensor is attached to the computer screen. It provides a 3D perspective of the surroundings (illustrates shape and depth). Lidar sensors can build a comprehensive 3D picture from signals that bounce back instantly. The chassis of our model will be bio composite and bioplastic using honeycomb, the same method as Dutch university 'grow car'.

            <P>
                Our wheelchair can be charged wirelessly or completely powered by batteries (installed under the chair). If the user is not sitting on the chair after 30 minutes, AI would automatically control the chair to the charging dock (station at home). Using wireless charge will take 5 to 6 hours for a full charge. When the battery is under 20%, AI will announce the current battery level through voice and wait for instruction from the user. After 30 minutes of inactivity from the user, it will move itself. It is suggested that users check their tires monthly. Use AI predictive maintenance. It will predict when future problems occur, as well as running in parallel with the active wheelchair to have a good evaluation.

                <p>
                    Installing a waterproof computer is a must because this would ensure the good condition of the computer despite various damaging external elements such as heavy rain, humidity, dust or high temperature.

                <p>
                    A "shock absorber" would support them in minimizing shock and vibrations caused to the wheels during the journey. This product would help to maintain the accurate operation of electrical components (and therefore ensures the safety of users).

                    Apply vehicle signal to protect the wheelchairs from thieves, using AI to track down the wheelchairs whenever it goes 1 meter away from the user.                </p>
